# Git-GitHub
An introduction to all things Git and GitHub as part of the Macquarie University 2021 eResearch Training Kickoff. 

## Description

Are you wanting to collaborate on documents or scripts? Or backup your work? This workshop will cover the basics of Git and GitHub. We will discuss using Git and GitHub to back up your work, make your work available (including to collaborators) and version control using Git and GitHub. This is the workshop for you if you have questions like: What are Git and GitHub? How do I set up Git and GitHub on my computer? What does it mean if I need to commit or push? What kind of files can I work with on Git and GitHub? How do I use Git and/or GitHub with the Shell or RStudio? Why canâ€™t I just email my document or code to my collaborator?
 
No knowledge of Git or GitHub is required. Signing up for a GitHub account before the workshop is recommended if you want to practice your new Git/GitHub skills alongside us. You can sign up for a GitHub account here: https://github.com. You will also need to download and configure git - instructions can be found in the file 'git_setup.pdf'.
 
The first part of the workshop will be using the command line and the second part using R & RStudio. Instructions for accessing the command line can be found in the 'git_setup.pdf' file. You can find instructions for downloading R and RStudio [here](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html).
 
This workshop was held on 18 February 2021 using Zoom.
